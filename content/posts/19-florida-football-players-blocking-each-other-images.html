    <h3>You may have seen the image from this saturday&#039;s game of the two florida gator teammates blocking each other.</h3>
    <p>I posted a thread last year about this phenomenon which can be found here here is this year&#039;s occurence: Two florida players became tangled on a solomon patton run in the second quarter of the gators&#039; loss to fcs georgia southern. The hard part is obviously when the threats are against your own players, death threats to your families, the ill will that&#039;s brought upon out there. Okay, but don&#039;t forget that one is an international football giant that won more world cups than any other country in the world, and even in our lowest we were able to reach the semis and get four of our players (with three defenders!) in.</p>
